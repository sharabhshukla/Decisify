# Decisify

Decisify is a Python package that leverages generative AI to explain decisions made by optimization models. 

## Introduction

Mathematical optimization is a critical tool in operations research, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions that maximize efficiency and minimize costs. However, the complexity of these models often makes it difficult for stakeholders to understand and trust the decisions being made. 

Decisify addresses this challenge by using generative AI to provide clear, understandable explanations for the decisions produced by optimization models. By enhancing transparency and trust, Decisify aims to drive greater adoption of optimization techniques across diverse industries.

## Features

- Explain optimization model decisions using generative AI
- Improve transparency and trust in operations research
- Facilitate the adoption of optimization techniques in various industries

## Installation

You can install Decisify using pip:

```bash
pip install decisify
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use Decisify:

```python
import decisify

# Your optimization model code here

# Generate explanations for the model's decisions
explanations = decisify.explain(model)
print(explanations)
```
